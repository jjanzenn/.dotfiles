#+title: =mpd= Configuration

Configure =mpd= as a music player. =services.mpd= only works on Linux for some reason so I manually write out the configuration here. This is actually a really gross setup and requires manually creating files in =.mpd= and manually starting =mpd=, but it does seem to work at least.
